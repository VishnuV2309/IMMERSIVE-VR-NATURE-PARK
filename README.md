# Immersive VR Nature Park

Built Using A-Frame
Developed by **Vishnu V (R23EI051)**

## Overview

Immersive VR Nature Park is a browser-based virtual reality experience that simulates a natural outdoor environment with trees, animals, water, fire, ambient audio, and interactive elements. Users can explore the park through teleportation movement and object interactions. The project is fully created using A-Frame, HTML, and JavaScript.

## Features

* Interactive objects (trees, ducks, rabbits, deer, water, fire)
* Teleportation-based movement
* Procedurally generated trees with sway animation
* Ambient and object-based sound effects
* Lightweight, browser-based VR (no installation needed)
* Works on desktop, laptop, and WebXR-supported devices

## How to Run

1. Keep all files (HTML + MP3 audio) in the same folder
2. Open `index.html` in Chrome or Edge
3. Click once to enable audio
4. Look around using mouse; click ground to teleport; click objects to interact

Internet is not required after files are downloaded.
